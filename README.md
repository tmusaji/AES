# AES
This tool encrypts and decrypts files using AES-256 encryption, a highly secure algorithm. It generates a random AES key for encryption, applies padding, and stores the Initialization Vector (IV) in the encrypted file. For decryption, it reads the IV and key, then recovers the original file data securely.
